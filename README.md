- 👋 Hi, I’m @gritwood
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of programming to move onto other languages with time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and how to write readable code.
- 💞️ At this time I'm not looking for collaborations, mostly just guidance on how to write better code.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by sending a message over GitHub.
